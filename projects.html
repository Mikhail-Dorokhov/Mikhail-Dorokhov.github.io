        <h3>mikhail-dorokhov.github.io</h3>
        <p>
    This was my first foray into web design. I challenged myself to build this
    site in just 2 days(Hackathon style) as a fun project over Spring break. I
    plan to update this site as I improve my Reactive Design skills and learn
    more about web development.<br>
    You can find the git repo <a href="https://github.com/Mikhail-Dorokhov/Mikhail-Dorokhov.github.io">here.</a>

        <h3>Automating the lights on my mouse</h3>
        <p>I recently was forced to replace my mouse. I chose the Steelseries
        Rival 100. So far my only complaint is that there is no button on the
      mouse to control the built in lights. To solve this, I decided to create
    an automated program to turn the lights on in the morning, and turn them off
  at night. </p>
