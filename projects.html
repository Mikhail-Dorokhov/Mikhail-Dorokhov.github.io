        <h3>mikhail-dorokhov.github.io</h3>
        <p>
    This was my first foray into web design. I challenged myself to build this
    site in just 2 days(Hackathon style) as a fun project over Spring break. By
    doing this project, I discovered a love for web design. I now tinker with this
    site as I learn more about web design, updating it weekly.<br>
    You can find the git repo <a href="https://github.com/Mikhail-Dorokhov/Mikhail-Dorokhov.github.io">here.</a>

        <h3>Automating the lights on my mouse</h3>
        <p>I recently was forced to replace my mouse. After doing my research, I
          chose the Steelseries Rival 100 which has been perfect except for the
          fact that there is no button on the mouse to turn off the built in lights.
          As a way of teaching my self about the basics of automation, I am creating
          a C++ program that uses a shell script to control the mouse lights based on
          the time of day by writing to virtual Linux files. This project is still in
          progress but you can find it <a href="https://github.com/Mikhail-Dorokhov/AutoRival100">here.</a>

        <h3>Live Data</h3>
        <p> The goal of this project is to learn javascript and jQuery as well as playing
          with live API's. The end goal of this project is to have a live view of what is
          going on around Northeastern such as T arrival times, Hubway station information, Weather
          information, and more. You can see the current state of the project <a href="LiveT.html">here.</a>
